This project is similar to the MusicApi project, but targets .Net Core 6.0, whereas the one from the
course targets .Net Core 5.0. They are quite similar, but in .Net Core 6.0 there is no Startup.cs file,
and the Program.cs file is somewhat different.

It still runs the same way, though, by switching to IIS Express in the toolbar at the button with the 
green triangle, and clicking it afterwards.
